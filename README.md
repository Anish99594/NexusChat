# NexusChat

## Introduction
The NexusChat is a blockchain-powered messaging platform built using the Calimero SDK. It enables users to create chat and voice rooms, send messages, and manage communication securely and transparently. With built-in user authentication and room encryption, this smart contract ensures privacy while leveraging decentralized technology for communication.

## Features
### User Management:
- Register users with a unique username and wallet address.
- Retrieve usernames and wallet addresses.

### Room Management:
- Create chat or voice rooms with password protection.
- Join rooms securely using a password.
- Retrieve room details and list available rooms.
- Delete rooms (only by the creator).
- View users in a room.

### Messaging:
- Send messages in a room (only by authorized users).
- Retrieve message history for a room.

### Signaling for Voice Rooms:
- Send signaling messages between users in a room for WebRTC-based voice communication.

## Contract Details
### User Registration
- Users register with a unique username and wallet address.
- Prevents duplicate usernames and wallet registrations.

### Room Creation
- Users create rooms with a specified type (Chat or Voice) and a password.
- Each room has a creator, user list, and message history.

### Joining a Room
- Users must provide the correct password to join a room.
- Upon joining, the user gets added to the roomâ€™s user list.

### Messaging
- Users in a room can send messages.
- Messages include sender, content, and timestamp.

### Signaling Messages
- Enables peer-to-peer voice communication via signaling messages.
- Only users in the room can exchange signaling messages.

### Leaving and Deleting Rooms

- Room creators can delete rooms.

## Events
- `RoomCreated { name: String }`
- `UserJoinedRoom { room: String, user: String }`
- `MessageSent { room: String, sender: String, content: String }`
- `RoomDeleted { name: String }`
- `UserRegistered { username: String, wallet_address: String }`
- `SignalingMessage { room: String, sender: String, receiver: String, content: String }`

## Security Considerations
- Users should only join rooms they trust, as messages are stored on-chain.
- Room passwords should be kept private to prevent unauthorized access.
- Smart contract security should be audited before deployment.
